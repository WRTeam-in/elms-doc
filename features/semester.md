# Semester

![Semester]

Moving forward, the admin can now associate semesters with each class. This allows the admin to organize and manage class schedules, subjects, and activities more effectively by linking them to specific semesters. When creating or editing a class, the admin will have the option to select the relevant semester, ensuring that all academic activities are properly aligned with the academic term structure.
