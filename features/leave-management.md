Teachers can apply for leave and check status of those from the application. Leave request can have date-range, but if there are any holiday days in that range they'll be auto-removed from the leave request. They can delete pending leave requests as well. Remaining and taken monthly leave count is also shown.

## Student Leave Management

Students or their parents can request leave directly through the eSchool app in a format similar to staff leave requests. They can choose specific days or a date range and select the type—first half, second half, or full day for each day in the request. Leave requests can't be made on holidays. Attachments, along with a reason for leave, can be added. Requests are sent to the class teacher, who can approve or decline with a comment. Once approved, the student's attendance status displays as "On Leave" while teachers take attendance, with the day marked as absent.
